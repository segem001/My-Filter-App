## Credits

 Many thanks to [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) documentation and [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) for availing resources online. We found their resources very useful throughout the course of my project. Their efforts in availing the resources was very instrumental in the success of my project. We would choose them over again and recommend any individual to check on their resources whenever they'd want anything code related.
